Next feature to add:
    - Ability to re-order items under morea_readings, morea_experiences, etc. labels with up/down buttons


Things to do/improve upon:
    - The fact that outcomes can occur under two headings (outcome_assessed, outcomes) breaks the initial
      assumption that there is a one-to-one mapping between a morea_type and a morea_types label... leads
      to very corner cases (noted as WARNING in the code) that will

    -  The Property that's either a list of a value is really lame and leads to a lot of "if type(xxx) == list",
       yay for hacking polymorphism by hand...
