Make a Python 3 version

Things to add to Testing:
    - Split the test suites into multiple files as it's becoming unwieldy?
    - Add type checking tests to the test suite

Things to improve upon:
    - The fact that outcomes can occur under two headings (outcomes_assessed, outcomes) breaks the initial assumption that there is a one-to-one mapping.
      As a result outcomes_assessed isn't really handled well (i.e., typechecking may fail)

    -  The Property that's either a list of a value is really lame and leads to a lot of "if type(xxx) == list",
       yay for hacking polymorphism by hand...
